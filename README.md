# Build-A-Data-Visualisation-Dashboard
**Project description**

Create three visualisations using the Flight Delays and Cancellations data set to reveal new insights.

**All about Data Set**

This data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays#flights.csv) in a Kaggle dataset that analyses the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by major air carriers in 2015.
The "flights.csv" file was used to create the data visualisations.
The files "airlines.csv" and "airports.csv" are only needed to supplement the main data in conjunction with the main file.
